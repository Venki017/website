		<p>Civil Engineering<br><br>
Civil Engineering is known as the mother of all Engineering disciplines.
It is the most versatile branch of Engineering. The term “Civil” means “relating to citizens or people”. And the reason for why it is called the mother of engineering is also very simple. Man needs a home, even animals for that matter.<br><br>

Major difference between Engineers and Doctors is A doctor is someone who is experienced and certified to practice medicine to help maintain or restore physical and mental health. Whereas Engineers are the professional who is involved in inventing, designing and maintaining a variety of structures and data system. Also responsible for adhering to their employee’s specifications for budget and timeline.<br><br>

In addition, civil engineering is one of the first branches of engineering developed by mankind and it acts as a platform to other forms of engineering. Generally Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways.<br><br>

Actually Civil Engineering is a very interesting form of engineering. It is the only engineering discipline where we can study and understand the concepts of design of structural elements of buildings, road geometry, loads and moment development, measurements of Earth and material behaviour. Also it is one of the best profit gaining career around the world.<br><br>

Engineer’s day – Sept 15 is celebrated to honor the hard work and efforts that engineers done to make our daily lives easier. This day is commemorates the birth anniversary of Sir. Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya was also the Diwan of Mysore, from 1912 to 1919. Aslo he is one of the great Civil Engineers of the world.<br><br>

Civil Engineers are the only people who can<br>
-	Control nature’s water flow<br>
-	Accommodating Homo sapines<br>
-	Contributing in Assets<br>
-	Built world<br>
-	Give meaning to infrastructure and more<br><br>

Civil engineering is a broad profession, including several specialized sub-disciplines, its history is linked to knowledge of structures, materials science, geography, geology, soils, hydrology, environmental science, mechanics, project management, and other fields.<br><br>

Throughout ancient and medieval history most architectural design and construction was carried out by artisans, such as stonemasons and carpenters, rising to the role of master builder. Knowledge was retained in guilds and seldom supplanted by advances. Structures, roads, and infrastructure that existed were repetitive, and increases in scale were incremental.<br><br>

It has been an aspect of life since the beginnings of human existence. The earliest practice of civil engineering may have commenced between 4000 and 2000 BC in ancient Egypt, the Indus Valley civilization, and Mesopotamia (ancient Iraq) when humans started to abandon a nomadic existence, creating a need for the construction of shelter. During this time, transportation became increasingly important leading to the development of the wheel and sailing.<br><br>

In the 18th century, the term civil engineering was coined to incorporate all things civilian as opposed to military engineering.<br>

In 1747, the first institution for the teaching of civil engineering, the École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées was established in France and more examples followed in other European countries, like Spain. The first self-proclaimed civil engineer was John Smeaton, who constructed the Eddystone Lighthouse.<br><br>
