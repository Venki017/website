        <h2>HOW TO BE RICH: MINDSET BEFORE MONEY</h2>

        <p>
            1. Think Long-Term*  <br>
Poor mindset: "How can I make money this week?"  <br>
Rich mindset: "How can I build something that pays me for life?"  <br>
→ Focus on *value creation*, not just quick gains.<br><br>

*2. Pay Yourself First*  <br>
Poor habit: Spend, then save what’s left.  <br>
Rich habit: Save/invest first, spend what’s left.  <br>
→ Even 10% of income saved early compounds big.<br><br>

*3. Learn Before You Earn*  <br>
Poor mindset: "I’ll start once I get rich."  <br>
Rich mindset: "I’ll get rich *by* starting now."  <br>
→ Read books, take free courses, watch how wealthy people think.<br><br>

*4. Buy Assets, Not Liabilities*  <br>
Assets = Make you money (stocks, real estate, skills)  <br>
Liabilities = Cost you money (luxury car, gadgets)  <br>
→ Know the difference.<br><br>

*5. Build Multiple Income Streams*  <br>
Start with one.  <br>
Then grow:  <br>
- Side hustle  <br>
- Freelance  <br>
- Digital products  <br>
- Investments  <br>
→ Don’t rely on one source.<br><br>

*6. Surround Yourself with Growth*  <br>
Talk money with people who talk goals. <br> 
→ Find mentors, not just friends.  <br>
→ Follow creators who teach, not flex.<br><br>

*7. Delay Gratification*  <br>
Poor mindset: "I earned it, I’ll spend it."  <br>
Rich mindset: "I earned it, I’ll *invest* it."  <br>
→ Say no now to say YES forever.<br><br>

*8. Track Everything*  <br>
Know where your money goes.<br>
→ Use a simple spreadsheet or app.  <br>
→ Monthly check = smarter decisions.<br><br>

*9. Work on Your Mindset Daily*  <br>
• Practice gratitude  <br>
• Visualize wealth  <br>
• Kill money guilt  <br>
→ You can’t build wealth if you believe you don’t deserve it.<br><br>

*10. Give Without Expectations*  <br>
Time, knowledge, or money.  <br>
→ What you give comes back multiplied.<br>
